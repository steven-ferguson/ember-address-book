Ember Address Book
==================

This is my second Ember application. I am using a Ruby on Rails backend with a PostgreSQL database. My goal for this project is to learn how to work with associated object in Ember. 

Running Javascript Tests
=======================
=======================

This app uses [Konacha](https://github.com/jfirebaugh/konacha) for Javascript testing. To run the tests startup a test server using:

```
bundle exec rake konacha:serve
```
 Then open [http://localhost:3500](http://localhost:3500) in your browser and the tests will automatically run.
